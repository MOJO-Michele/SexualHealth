 A DETAILED SLIDE DECK THAT ANSWERS THE FOLLOWING QUESTIONS: 
 
 WHAT IS THE RANGE OF REALISTIC TIMELINES IN WHICH A BNAB PRODUCT FOR HIV PREVENTION OF SEXUAL TRANSMISSION AND/OR POST-NATAL PROPHYLAXIS TO INFANTS COULD BE APPROVED AND INTRODUCED IN COUNTRIES WITH THE HIGHEST INCIDENCE OF HIV IN AFRICA? 
 
 WHAT ARE THE KEY MILESTONES FOR THIS TO HAPPEN AND WHICH MILESTONES ARE THE MOST UNCERTAIN/RISKIEST AND MOST LIKELY TO AFFECT THE TIMELINE?Â ¯ 
 
 WHAT ARE THE TRADEOFFS IN TERMS OF TIMELINES, COST, AND EXPECTED EFFICACY BETWEEN A BNAB COMBINATION CONTAINING TWO BNABS TO A COMBINATION CONTAINING THREE BNABS TO A SINGLE, TRI-SPECIFIC BNAB? 
 
 WITH THE CURRENT PIPELINE OF AVAILABLE AND EXPECTED LONG-ACTING INJECTABLE ARVS IN THE PIPELINE IN THE NEAR HORIZON, WILL THERE BE A CONTINUED SUBSTANTIAL PUBLIC HEALTH NEED OR NICHE FOR BNABS FOR: A) PREVENTION OF SEXUAL TRANSMISSION OF HIV IN ADULTS AND B) POST-NATAL PROPHYLAXIS TO INFANTS. FOR ADULTS, PLEASE EXPLORE THE POTENTIAL OF BOTH AN INTRAVENOUSLY ADMINISTERED PRODUCT AND A SUBCUTANEOUS OR INTRAMUSCULAR PRODUCT FOR BNABS. 
 
 WHAT IS THE PROBABILITY THAT EITHER MULTINATIONALS OR LMIC MANUFACTURERS WOULD ENGAGE IN DEVELOPMENT OF BNABS AS PRODUCTS FOR HIV PREVENTION OF SEXUAL TRANSMISSION AND OR POST-NATAL PROPHYLAXIS TO INFANTS? 
 
 4. WHAT WOULD THE COGS OF BNABS NEED TO BE FOR THEM TO BE COMPETITIVE WITH LONG-ACTING INJECTABLE ARVS IN LMIC? 
 
 WHAT ARE THE PROJECTED COGS FOR BNABS FOR POST-NATAL PROPHYLAXIS TO INFANTS? 
 
 WHAT ARE THE PROJECTED COGS FOR BNABS FOR HIV PREVENTION IN ADULTS? 
 
 HOW COULD THE USE OF BNABS FOR HIV TREATMENT AFFECT THE COST AND AVAILABILITY OF BNABS FOR PREVENTION IF THE SAME BNABS ARE UTILIZED IN BOTH INDICATIONS? 
 
 EXPECTED OUTCOMES 
 
 USAID WILL HAVE EVIDENCE-BASED INFORMATION REGARDING THE MARGINAL VALUE ADD OF BNABS ONCE LEN-PREP IS INTRODUCED AND WE HOPE THAT THE ANALYSIS GUIDES ON WHICH PRODUCTS AND TECHNOLOGIES TO CONTINUE TO INVEST IN.Â ¯Â ¯Â ¯",,,,,,,,,,,https://www.usaspending.gov/award/CONT_AWD_7200AA20M00014_7200_47QRAA18D00F8_4732/,2023-09-11 08:03:58+00

 THIS PROJECT REQUIRES MITRE AND ITS SUBCONTRACTORS, THE RESEARCH TRIANGLE INSTITUTE, INTERNATIONAL (RTI) AND ATLAS RESEARCH, INC. (ATLAS), TO: 
 Ï¿½ REVISE THE SYSTEMATIC METHOD FOR ASSESSING RISK-AVOIDANCE TOOL (SMARTOOL) TO REFLECT THE MOST CURRENT RESEARCH EVIDENCE, AND

 THE SMARTOOL PROGRAM TOOL, RELEASED IN 2008, PROVIDES A FRAMEWORK GROUNDED IN RESEARCH FOR CHOOSING A SEXUAL RISK AVOIDANCE (SRA) CURRICULUM AND IMPLEMENTING A SUCCESSFUL SRA APPROACH.  CURRENTLY, IT IS USED BY SCHOOLS, YOUTH-SERVING ORGANIZATIONS, AND OTHER AGENCIES INTERESTED IN PRESENTING RISK-AVOIDANCE EDUCATION TO YOUTH. AS OF JULY 2018, IN COLLABORATION WITH THE CENTER FOR RELATIONSHIP EDUCATION, MITRE (AND ITS SUBCONTRACTORS: RTI AND ATLAS) HAVE COMPLETED ONE ROUND OF REVISIONS TO THE SMARTOOL WHICH RESULTED IN THE RELEASE OF SMARTOOL SUMMARY DOCUMENT.  THE SMARTOOL 2.0 IS ORGANIZED INTO TEN TARGETS AND PRESENTS A FRAMEWORK OF EVIDENCE-INFORMED STRATEGIES MOST LIKELY TO ACHIEVE POSITIVE BEHAVIORS AND ATTITUDES RELATED TO SEXUAL RISK TAKING.
 REMAINING ACTIVITIES ON THE SMARTOOL PILOT REPLICATION PROJECT INCLUDE: 
 Ï¿½ A FORMATIVE EVALUATION INVOLVING UP TO FOUR (4) ORGANIZATIONS IMPLEMENTING SRA CURRICULA THAT ALIGN WITH THE SMARTOOL 2.0. 
 Ï¿½ A SECOND ROUND OF UPDATES TO THE SMARTOOL INFORMED BY THE FINDINGS OF THE FORMATIVE EVALUATION TO DEVELOP SMARTOOL 3.0.

 Ï¿½ TO COLLECT INFORMATION ABOUT THE DELIVERY OF SRA CURRICULA THAT ALIGN WITH THE SMARTOOLÏ¿½INCLUDING QUALITY, ADHERENCE TO THE CONTENT AND TEACHING METHODS, AND PARTICIPANT SATISFACTION;
 Ï¿½ TO ASSESS SHORT-TERM CHANGES AMONG PARTICIPANTS IN THE YOUTH PROGRAM REGARDING KEY SMARTOOL TARGETS, SUCH AS PERSONAL INTENTION AND COMMITMENT TO AVOID SEXUAL ACTIVITY, PERSONAL COMPETENCIES AND SELF-EFFICACY TO AVOID SEXUAL ACTIVITY, AND PERSONAL ATTITUDES AND BELIEFS THAT VALUE SEXUAL RISK AVOIDANCE; AND 
 Ï¿½ TO DEVELOP AND TEST BASELINE AND FOLLOW-UP YOUTH SURVEYS THAT ALIGN WITH KEY TOPICS IN THE SMARTOOL THAT MAY BE USED IN THE FUTURE AS A MODEL FOR UNIFORM DATA COLLECTION.
 TO ACCOMPLISH OASHÏ¿½S GOALS FOR THE FORMATIVE EVALUATION, MITRE WILL CONTRACT WITH MULTIPLE CONTRACTORS (ALSO REFERRED TO AS Ï¿½IMPLEMENTING ORGANIZATIONSÏ¿½ (IOS)), DEFINED AS ORGANIZATIONS FOCUSED ON HEALTH, EDUCATION, AND SOCIAL SERVICES THAT HAVE EXPERIENCE WORKING WITH SCHOOLS OR SCHOOL DISTRICTS OR COMMUNITY-BASED ORGANIZATIONS TO IMPLEMENT SRA PROGRAMMING.

MITRE (AND ITS SUBCONTRACTORS) WILL WORK WITH EACH IO TO REFINE THEIR PROGRAM IMPLEMENTATION PLANS AND PREPARE FOR THE FORMATIVE EVALUATION STUDY.
